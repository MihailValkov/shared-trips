## Getting Started
Clone this repository and install dependencies
```
> git clone https://github.com/MihailValkov/shared-trips.git
> cd server
> npm install
> create '.env' file.
> npm start
```
### Create '.env' file in the main directory and populate the following data:

* `USER` -- MongoDB Cloud user;
* `PASSWORD` -- MongoDB Cloud password for the current user;
* `DB_NAME` -- MongoDB Cloud Database;
* `SECRET` -- Secret for JWT;
* `AUTH_COOKIE` -- Name of the cookie;
* `ROUNDS` -- Number for bcrypt hashing password;

### Example
```
USER=
PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=
SECRET=
AUTH_COOKIE=
ROUNDS=
```
Or you can navigate to file `config.js` in folder `config` and fulfill the following properties `port`, `dbConnection`,`cookie_name`, `jwt_secret` and `rounds`. Also, if you do not have a MongoDB Cloud account, you can set the value of the `dbConnection` variable `'mongodb://localhost:27017/{DB_NAME}'`

### Example
```
{
    port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
    dbConnection: mongodb://localhost:27017/Shared_Trips',
    cookie_name: 'my_cookie_name',
    jwt_secret: 'my_jwt_secret_key',
    rounds: 10,
    defaultFields: {
        male: 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSc-SyW3qGqxIkZS43hnjvOvVVZ7cEGjDIY5-zZgf6dz6wb37Zq&s',
